# LangChain Private and Public Hubs

LangChainHub is collection of all artifacts useful for working with LangChain primitives such as 
prompts, chains and agents. The goal of this repository is to be a central resource for sharing 
and discovering high quality prompts, chains and agents that combine together to form complex LLM 
applications.

# Public Hub
  
  Prefix: `lc`

The public hub utilizes the collection of templates from the original [LangChainHub](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-hub)
repository. As we do not control access to these templates, read-only access to the templates is available, but
any changes to the templates cannot be persisted.

Some Examples:

- `lc|chains|hello-world|chain`: [Hello World Chain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-hub/tree/main/chains/hello-world)
- `lc|chains|summarize|stuff|chain`: [Summarize Chain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-hub/blob/main/chains/summarize/stuff)

# Private Hub

  Prefix: `lcx`

The private hub is a collection of templates that are owned by our team at [llmx-hub](https://github.com/GrowthEngineAI/llmx-hub). 
This allows us to make changes to the templates and persist them to the hub. This is useful for testing and development purposes.

Some Examples:

- `lcx|chains|hello-world|chain`: [Hello World Chain](https://github.com/GrowthEngineAI/llmx-hub/tree/main/chains/hello-world)
- `lcx|prompts|bizdev|rfp|audit_plan`: [Audit Plan Prompt](https://github.com/GrowthEngineAI/llmx-hub/blob/main/prompts/bizdev/rfp/audit_plan.yaml)
